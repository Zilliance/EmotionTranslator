"learn more conversation introduction" = "This exercise uses the power of stream-of-consciousness (or freeform) writing, which is writing without thinking or editing yourself, to access your Inner Wisdom. \n\nAt first it might seem kind of silly, but giving voice to an emotion (or whatever you’re dialoguing with) and being curious about what comes out bypasses your thinking mind, which can get caught up in limiting or faulty thoughts and beliefs, and allows you to hear your Inner Wisdom about what you need to feel better and take care of yourself. \n\nSometimes it takes a minute or so for the good stuff to come out, so don’t worry if you don’t think you have anything to say at first. You might spend the first few sentences writing about how silly it feels to be doing this exercise. But if you just keep writing and go with it, we guarantee you will have an aha moment.";
